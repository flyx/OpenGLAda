# The package `GL.Context`

This package lets you query various information about the current OpenGL
context:

 * Major and minor OpenGL version (since OpenGL 3)
 * Version string (legacy for OpenGL 1/2)
 * Vendor
 * Renderer
 * List of supported extensions
 * Primary shading language version
 * List of supported shading language versions

There is also `Has_Extension`, which checks whether a given extension
name is part of the extension list (in case when you're wondering why
the corresponding GLFW function has not been wrapped; this function
provides the same functionality).
