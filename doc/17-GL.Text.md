# The package `GL.Text`

This package is only available if you include the project `opengl-text.gpr` as
a dependency to your project. It depends on the FreeType wrapper and the
external library [Strings_Edit][1], which you have to install on your system in
order to use `GL.Text` (for example by means of `gprinstall`).

`GL.Text` is able to produce monochrome textures containing arbitrary text. You
can use those textures in shaders to render the text with any color or texture
you want. To support non-ASCII characters, `GL.Text` takes UTF-8-encoded Strings
as input. It uses `Strings_Edit` to decode these Strings.

`GL.Text` serves as a base for simple String rendering and as example for users
who want to do more complex things with text using the `FreeType` binding.
