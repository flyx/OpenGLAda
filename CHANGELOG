v0.9.0
 * Alire support: Project now supplies several Alire Crates.
 * Added package:
   - GL.Debug
 * Added missing functionality in:
   - GLFW.Windows.Hints (several hints)
   - GL.Objects.Buffers (Shader_Storage_Buffer)

v0.8.0
 * __Breaking change__: Removed SOIL since it doesn't compile on macOS Catalina
   and replaced it with GID. Added `opengl-images.gpr` to replace SOIL
   functionality.
 * __Breaking change__: Removed the long-deprecated FTGL binding.
 * Fixed the binding of `glGetTransformFeedbackVarying`
 * Fixed a bug when creating an empty Depth_Component texture (#135)
 * Added package:
   - GL.Objects.Queries
 * Added missing functionality in:
   - GL.Rasterization (glPolygonOffset)
   - GL.Objects.Buffers (glDrawTransformFeedback, glDrawTransformFeedbackStream,
                         glGenTransformFeedbacks, glDeleteTransformFeedbacks,
                         glBindTransformFeedback, glMapBufferRange,
                         glFlushMappedBufferRange, glGetBufferSubData)

 * Fixed a bug when querying shaders from a program object (#129).
v0.7.0:
 * Added missing functionality in:
   - GL.Objects.Buffers (glBindBufferBase, glDrawElementsInstanced,
                         texture buffer target)
   - GL.Objects.Programs (transform feedback)
 * Fixed memory leaks during C-string handling.
 * Deprecated old GL.Attributes.Set_Vertex_Attrib_Pointer in favor for
   new subroutines there that provide more control.
 * Small fixes in tests so that they work on Windows again.
 * Made it work with GNAT Community 2018.
 * Changed to SemVer versioning (added revision number)
 * Improvements to GL.Object system
 * Fixed problems in uniforms setter (#105)
 * Removed dependency to Strings_Edit by implementing UTF-8
   in GL.Text.
 * Fixed a bug in GL.Culling (#110)
 * added GL.Objects.Vertex_Arrays.Draw_Arrays_Instanced
 * Added Windows Installer
v0.6:
 * Changed license to MIT which is more well-known than ISC
 * Added missing functionality in:
   - GL.Objects.Buffers (offset for Draw_Elements, #93)
 * Enforce no compiler warnings
 * Added FreeType binding and GL.Text
 * Deprecated FTGL binding in favor of the new FreeType binding and GL.Text
v0.5:
 * Added missing functionality in:
   - GL.Programs (tessellation, glBindFragDataLocation)
   - GL.Rasterization (point stuff)
   - GL.Object.Textures.Targets (glTexStorage, glCompressedTexImage)
   - Glfw.Windows (Set_Input_Toggle, Get_Cursor_Mode)
 * Fixed an off-by-one bug in GL.Contexts
 * Reimplemented runtime loading system. It is now much more efficient (does not
   need to look up a string in a hashtable each time a subprogram is called)
   and the Ada code is autogenerated. The generator also produces a mapping
   table from OpenGL function names to the OpenGLAda wrapper, available on the
   website.
 * Various fixes to GL.Objects reference counting system
 * Fixed a bug in GL.Pixels by splitting Format into Data_Format and
   Framebuffer_Format
 * Made matrices column-major to conform with GLSL layout.
 * Fixed a bug in matrix multiplication.
 * Fixed a bug in Windows backend that made OpenGLAda unusable on Windows 10.
v0.4:
 * Added packages:
  - GL.Culling
  - GL.Framebuffer
  - GL.Objects.Lists
  - GL.Rasterization
 * Renamed packages:
   - GL.Pixel_Data to GL.Pixels
   - GL.Objects.Buffer to GL.Objects.Buffers
 * Added missing functionality in:
   - GL.Blending (various)
   - GL.Buffers (various)
   - GL.Objects.Buffers (various)
   - GL.Objects.Framebuffers (various)
   - GL.Objects.Programs:
     * Attached_Shaders
     * Get_Program_Stage
     * Get_Subroutine_Index
     * Subroutine_Uniform_Locations
   - GL.Objects.Shaders (Release_Shader_Compiler)
   - GL.Objects.Textures:
     * Generate_Mipmap
     * Invalidate_Image
     * Invalidate_Sub_Image
   - GLFW.Windows (Set_Cursor_Mode, Disable_Callback)
 * GLFW 3: Raise exception if window creation fails
 * Added LIBRARY_TYPE scenario variable
 * Various bugfixes

   - GL.Context
   - GL.Blending
   - GL.Raster
   - GL.Objects.Framebuffers
   - GL.Objects.Renderbuffers
   - GL.Objects.Textures.Targets
 * Overhauled texture API and made it possible to create and load data into
   all kinds of textures
 * Made exception raising optional by compile-time switch rather than by
   setting a flag at runtime (performance increasement). Exposed GL.Errors to
   manually handle errors if exceptions are disabled.
 * Added support for GLFW 3
 * Added support for SOIL
 * Added support for FTGL
 * Sanitized and cleaned up build system

v0.2:

 * Added joystick support to GLFW wrapper.

   Breaks existing code.
 * Better handling of texture unit count
 * Added Makefile
 * Added proper README

v0.1:

 * Initial release
