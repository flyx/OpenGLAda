These examples are based on the tutorials available at http://duriansoftware.com/joe/An-intro-to-modern-OpenGL.-Table-of-Contents.html using Glfw version 3.
The version numbers in the shader programs may need modification depending on your
platform.

GNAT Programming Studio (GPS) Considerations
Use Tools->Views->Scenarios to display the Scenario panel.
In the Scenario panel set GLFW Version to 3.
For Mac, in the Scenario panel set Windowing System to quartz.
In Preferences, ensure that Editor->Fonts & Colors->Default is set to a fixed size font.
In Preferences->Editor->Ada set appropriate format selectors.
