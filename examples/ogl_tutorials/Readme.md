These examples are based on the tutorials available at http://www.opengl-tutorial.org using Glfw version 3.
The version numbers in the shader programs may need modification depending on your
platform.
For Mac users, note that the Glfw provided with OSX is incompatible with OpenGLAda as it does not contain libglfw.a.
A compatible version can be obtained from Homebrew: brew install glfw.

GNAT Programming Studio (GPS) Considerations
Use Tools->Views->Scenarios to display the Scenario panel.
In the Scenario panel set GLFW Version to 3.
For Mac, in the Scenario panel set Windowing System to quartz.
In Preferences, ensure that Editor->Fonts & Colors->Default is set to a fixed size font.
In Preferences->Editor->Ada set appropriate format selectors.
