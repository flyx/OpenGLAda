This example contains a version of the "common" directory that differs from that
used by all of the other examples. The changes in the "common" code would have
broken the other examples and thus a local copy is used here (the alternative of
updating all the other examples to suit was deemed too ivolved to be worth the
effort on this occassion -- it may be worth the effort for later versions).
